The server directory contains the server application which requires Linux as well as PHP and Apache to run. It contains two folders, config and public_html. The first one contains the private part of the application, where configuration files containing login data to the website (.htpasswd), database login data (config.php) and names and passwords of network devices (devices.php) are stored. These files should be completed before the first run. The public_html directory is the part of the application provided by the Apache server. Apart from the website, it also contains PHP scripts for inserting and retrieving data from the database: insert.php and query.php. The configuration paths in these files must also be set in advance. After completing these steps, the website should load after entering the appropriate address in the browser and providing login data.

To start the functionality of inserting data records from devices to the database, it is required to pre-set configuration files on the server and individual devices. Transmission can be tested using the cURL tool. It is mandatory to provide the device id and password as part of the query. Shortened 4-letter names are used instead of full field names - you can check them by looking at the header of the insert.php file. In case of incorrect data, the script will return the message "Authentication error". Below is an example command:
curl -X POST -d 'date = 2021-01-01 & temp = 0.0' http://www.student.agh.edu.pl/~lkalina/insert.php?id=test&pass=123
